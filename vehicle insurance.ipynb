A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.\n\nFor example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n\nJust like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
